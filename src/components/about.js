       Hello there! My name is Grant and I am driven to excel. This drive comes from the need to do my best. I am goal-oriented and have learned that great productivity is achieved by taking small, consistent steps. What I set out to do, I accomplish. Every adventure is a new opportunity for learning and I constantly seek to expand my knowledge.

       The desire for improvement has led me into the world of computer programming and web development. I've gained a passion for coding and web design. Coding can provide quite the challenge, but I find it to be very rewarding. I enjoy working with good teams on projects and appreciate the quiet moments for individual problem-solving. Whether on a team or working solo, I always offer my best.
